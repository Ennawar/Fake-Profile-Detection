# Fake-Profile-Detection
This project focuses on identifying fake or suspicious user profiles on social media platforms or online communities using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The aim is to detect accounts that are likely to be bots, spammers, or fake identities by analyzing patterns in their behavior and profile information.

The system uses various features such as profile completeness, activity frequency, content originality, follower-following ratio, and posting patterns to classify profiles as genuine or fake. A machine learning model is trained on labeled datasets of real and fake profiles to make accurate predictions.

‚ú® Key Features:

Analyzes multiple features of user profiles.

Uses machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression).

Predicts whether a profile is real or fake.

Helps platforms reduce spam, scams, and fake engagement.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Scikit-learn for building and training ML models

Jupyter Notebook for development and testing

Visualization tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn for insights

‚úÖ Outcome:
A functional model that predicts the authenticity of user profiles based on selected features, helping online platforms maintain trust and security by minimizing fake accounts.
